# create_asm (right now it doesn't work)
An assembler, and language spec for the iRobot create v1.
Usage: ./create_asm inputfile.asm output file.c
This will take the input, and output a c file to run on a kipr link (used in bot ball) to reprogram the irobot create v1.

Disclaimer, as of now there is absolutly no error checking, and this code is very BETA, and its mostly dead and dosn't work.
